// Configuration switches; remove/add a double-slash at line-start to enable/disable a feature; to save space disable e.g. CAT, DIAG, KEYER

/* Very approximate firmware size of various functionality (using gcc 7.3.0):
 * DIAG - 1308 bytes
 * CAT - 4150 bytes
 * CW_DECODER - 1468 bytes
 * CW_INTERMEDIATE - 20 bytes
 * FAST_AGC - 700 bytes
 * SWR_METER - 1724 bytes
 * SWR_METER + INA219_POWER_METER - 2580 bytes
 * note: combinations of these are not additive, so don't assume that disabling DIAG and CAT will save exactly 4150+1308=5458 bytes
